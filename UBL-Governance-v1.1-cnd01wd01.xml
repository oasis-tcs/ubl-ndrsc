      <title>Governance</title>
      <para>The OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL) is an important and useful XML standard for exchanging business documents. The more the standard is implemented, the more requirements emerge for new areas of business. Therefore the OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL) TC has documented the
        processes by which UBL can be further enhanced to address additional requirements.</para>
      <para>New and existing implementers analyze the UBL standard looking for a way to express their required business information in XML document structures. But no standard can be all things to all people. There inevitably will be information required for business processes that are not currently
        supported. </para>
      <para>There are many ways implementers can resolve this situation. However, interoperability is inhibited if different approaches are used to address the same business requirements. Interoperability can be enhanced if UBL incorporates common solutions to accommodate these additional
        requirements.</para>
      <para>This Committee Note provides guidance for UBL implementers to contribute proposals for additional business processes including additional document types or additional information requirements for consideration as candidates for the UBL standard. Significantly, these guidelines identify a
        process that allows implementers to apply their own solutions immediately within their current environment and still contribute these to future releases of UBL.</para>
      <para>The aim of this Committee Note is to create security and certainty for organizations and communities investing in UBL implementations by documenting the governance procedures to ensure business requirements are met currently and into the future.</para>
      <para>Finally, the document outlines the anticipated release cycle and time schedules for each phase of the OASIS standardization process. This will allow implementers to manage their expectations for candidate proposals and guide them in the timing of their submissions. </para>

      <para>It should be noted that a proposal that is incomplete or is a statement along the lines of “UBL should contain a...” will require more time to process than a proposal complete with the information the UBL TC needs to consider and implement the suggestions.</para>

    <section id="S-IS-THIS-REALLY-A-NEW-REQUIREMENT">
      <title>Is this really a new requirement?</title>
      <para>The UBL standard appears complex because of the wide-ranging scope of solutions where it plays a role. Those new to UBL may be unable to find an existing component to support their requirement, or they may create their own extension component unknowingly duplicating an existing
        component. </para>
      <para>UBL has been in production for many years and has been tested and deployed in many organizations. As an example, in Denmark UBL for invoicing has been in production and required by law on a regional and national level for more than 15 years. Occasionally implementers in Denmark identify
        what they believe are new requirements. In many cases these are already addressed by the UBL standard, though perhaps in a different manner to how the implementers conceived them.</para>

    <section id="S-PRESERVING-BACKWARD-COMPATIBILITY">
      <title>Preserving backward compatibility</title>
      <para>It is required that proposals for enhancements preserve backward compatibility with the previous version of UBL. This is enforced through rules on the acceptable cardinality of proposed changes to elements.</para>
      <para>The cardinality of a UBL element means the number of times the element is allowed to exist at the particular point in the document tree (between the immediately-preceding element of another name and the immediately-following element of another name).</para>
      <para>Cardinality applies to leaf and branch elements of the document tree. </para>
      <para>There are four possible values for cardinality:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>the element is optional and cannot be repeated if it exists</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>the element is mandatory and cannot be repeated</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>the element is optional and if it exists it can be repeated with immediate like-named element siblings</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>the element is mandatory and can be repeated with immediate like-named element siblings</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>In order to preserve backward compatibility with all previous versions of UBL, the cardinality of all proposed new or modified elements is strictly controlled. </para>
      <para>For example, backward compatibility means that every conceivable schema-valid instance of UBL 2.0 also is a schema-valid instance of UBL 2.1 and all subsequent minor revisions of UBL. Similarly every schema-valid instance of UBL 2.1 also shall be a schema-valid instance of UBL 2.2 and
        all subsequent minor revisions of UBL.</para>
      <para>The following cardinality scenarios are mandated to preserve backward compatibility:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>an existing container element can have only optional additions to its children.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>a new container element can have any new, or re-use existing, children, each with any cardinality, including being mandatory.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>an existing element can have its minimum cardinality decreased or its maximum cardinality increased. This means an element cannot be removed or deprecated.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Therefore any proposed changes to existing elements should be as follows:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>from optional singular to optional multiple</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>from mandatory singular to mandatory multiple</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>from mandatory singular to optional singular</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>from mandatory singular to optional multiple </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>from mandatory multiple to optional multiple</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Guaranteeing forward compatibility is not practical because of the additional elements in forward releases. For example, a UBL 2.1 instance is not guaranteed to be a schema-valid instance of UBL 2.0 because it may contain an element not defined in UBL 2.0.</para>
      <para>However it is true that a user of UBL 2.1 choosing only to use UBL 2.0 elements in the UBL 2.1 document will have an instance that is schema-valid with the UBL 2.0 schemas. The UBL Customization Guidelines at <ulink conformance="skip"
          url="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/guidelines/UBL2-Customization1.0cs01.pdf"><emphasis role="underline">http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/guidelines/UBL2-Customization1.0cs01.pdf</emphasis></ulink> makes reference to potential forward-compatible processing by pruning from a document those
        elements that a system does not recognize. </para>
    </section>
    <section id="S-PROPOSING-FORMATTED-TEXT-ELEMENTS">
      <title>Proposing formatted text elements</title>
      <para>UBL is a transactional data language and as such there is no concept of “paragraphs of text”, “field lengths” or other presentational facets. </para>
      <para>A single element of a textual data type is a continuous string of text from the start tag of the element to the end tag of the element without any formatting characteristics.</para>
      <para>UBL does support repeating textual elements but only where the same information may be required in different languages. These are not designed to convey different sets of information – such as different paragraphs or lines.</para>
      <para>Therefore a proposal for a textual element (such as a description) may have multiple cardinality but if repeated each instance should contain different translations of the same information (indicated by a language identifier).</para>
    </section>
    <section id="S-USING-THE-UBL-EXTENSION-POINT">
      <title>Using the UBL extension point</title>
      <para>All UBL document schemas provide an extension point to accommodate additional information elements. This extension point provides a technical solution for custom requirements to be met within standard UBL documents. In UBL 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 there is a single extension point found at the
        beginning of the document element so as to be encountered in a serial parsing of the document before elements that the extension point may influence. In UBL 2.3 and subsequent releases there are additional extension points, one found at the beginning of every manifest ASBIE of the document.
        This is every element that, itself, has element children also has an optional UBL extension point as the first of all its element children.</para>
      <para>It should be noted that interoperability is inhibited if each implementer uses the extension point syntax differently to express the same requirement. Accordingly, it behooves industry sectors or other UBL communities to agree amongst themselves how non-UBL content is to be expressed,
        and where it is to be expressed, in a UBL document.</para>
      <para>The sender of a document cannot be guaranteed that the receiver of the document recognizes any extension. Thus, it is important not to require processing of any given extension for the successful processing of the document itself. Extensions should be used only for additional information
        that the receiver may be in a position to access.</para>
      <para>The UBL extension point is useful when proposing to the committee that new elements be included in the UBL specification. One can create illustrative test documents including the proposed new elements in the context of the ABIE in which the proposal is being made by using that ABIE’s
        extension point where manifest.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="S-USING-THE-UBL-NAMESPACES">
      <title>Using the UBL namespaces</title>
      <para>Namespaces are critically important in XML, and thus are critically important in UBL. Unfortunately, the simple concept embodied by XML namespaces is often misunderstood, leading to confusion with users. Regrettably, the verbose nature of UBL namespaces contributes to the mistaken
        impression that the namespaces somehow are adding to the complexity of the XML in UBL documents.</para>
      <para>This Committee Note does not attempt to explain the technical declaration syntax for XML namespaces. See <xref linkend="A-DECLARING-NAMESPACES"/> for more details regarding choosing and using namespaces.</para>

      <section id="S-CONTRIBUTING-A-SCHEMA">
        <title>Contributing a schema</title>
        <para>A proposal to the UBL Technical Committee may also benefit from including representative XML schemas that satisfy the requirements of the proposal. These may be those used in an actual implementation by the proposer.</para>
        <para>If the proposer wishes to submit demonstration schemas that remain compatible with existing UBL document types, then the proposed new components must be implemented as UBL Extensions.</para>
      </section>
      <section id="S-CONTRIBUTIONS-BASED-ON-UBL-EXTENSION">
        <title>Contributions based on UBL extension</title>
        <para>Proposers may submit an XML schema based on the UBL extension methodology to illustrate their proposal. Pre-UBL-2.3 the UBL extension is allowed only at the beginning of the document element. From UBL 2.3 and beyond, a UBL extension is allows at the beginning of any ASBIE element
          defined by an ABIE.</para>
        <para>The use of a UBL extension in a proposal does not signify that the extended content itself will become part of the UBL standard. If deemed appropriate the UBL TC will incorporate the proposed elements in the libraries or document types of the next release.</para>
        <para>Proposers may choose to hand-craft their schemas. Alternatively they may choose to copy the UBL Signature Extension spreadsheet (as an example) and use publicly-available tools to generate the schemas. </para>
        <para>The UBL TC does not provide a schema generation service for those creating their own document models or proposing enhancements to UBL. Interested parties seeking assistance may use publicly-available software or consult with companies who can provide such a service. The UBL community
          web site has listings of candidate products and services at, respectively, <ulink url="http://ubl.xml.org/products"><emphasis role="underline">http://ubl.xml.org/products</emphasis></ulink> and <ulink url="http://ubl.xml.org/services"><emphasis role="underline"
              >http://ubl.xml.org/services</emphasis></ulink>.</para>
        <para>A UBL extension is presented in XML using three custom non-standard-UBL namespace URI strings. One string is for the extension apex, one is for the non-Standard-UBL aggregates and association components, and one is for the non-standard-UBL basic components. The standard-UBL namespace
          URI strings are used for those UBL components that already exist in the standard-UBL model and schemas.</para>

        <title>Contributions based on non-UBL XML schemas</title>
        <para>If the proposer wishes their demonstration schemas to describe the desired document type incorporating their additions then the proposer is obliged to use non-Standard-UBL namespace URI strings for all components. </para>
        <para>While this will be compatible (but not conformant) with the UBL standard at the time of the submission, if the proposed changes are adopted fully then simply changing the namespace URIs would identify the standard UBL Schema.</para>

    <para>All exchanges on the UBL public comment list, be they questions or submissions of any kind, are publicly-archived and individual posts may not be removed from the archive.</para>
    <para>Proposers should note that the more time the UBL TC has to review a contribution before the release cycle deadlines, the more chance the submission will get full consideration. Any submission received that is not able to have full consideration may be delayed for consideration in a later

  <appendix id="A-DECLARING-NAMESPACES">
    <title>Declaring namespaces</title>
    <para>The focus of this appendix is to guide the reader regarding the selection of XML namespaces used in UBL and in user contributions to the committee.</para>
    <para>The sole role of namespaces in UBL documents is to distinguish element names found in separate collections of element names where the element names otherwise would be ambiguous because they have the same spelling. A simple example in UBL is the comparison of the ABIE named “Location” and
      the BBIE named “Location”. These are different Business Information Entities and so the components have different XML element structures. The ABIE named “Location” is comprised of elements as children. The BBIE named “Location” is comprised only of text. They cannot both be expressed in a
      single XML document using the markup &lt;Location&gt; as neither the user nor the XML processor interpreting the markup knows which ASBIE (pointing to the ABIE) or BBIE component is being referenced. Therefore, to avoid ambiguity, the identically-named components must come from separate
      collections.</para>
    <para>To avoid ambiguity users of UBL have the responsibility to use unique user-defined namespaces for their defined components, and to use only the standard UBL namespaces for standard-UBL components.</para>
    <para>While the choice of a unique namespace prefix name is irrelevant to the XML process, good practice promotes human understanding. Accordingly, the UBL Naming and Design Rules chooses to use the same set of abbreviations for all UBL namespace prefix names. The rules also define the empty
      prefix be used for XML root elements (the top-most element or very first element that surrounds all information).</para>
    <para>In UBL all Library ABIEs belong in a single collection. </para>
    <para>XML namespace URIs should be considered as organizational assets, and as such, they should be managed accordingly. Care should be taken when defining a URI string for a collection that that string has not already been used for a different collection elsewhere in the organization’s XML
      corpus.</para>
    <para>URL strings have a strict (but unenforced) syntax of an absolute URL that should use a domain owned by the user. URN strings have a strict (but unenforced) syntax of allowed values in the second field, called the “URN Namespace” (for example, OASIS has formally registered “oasis” as a URN
      namespace and so is allowed to use it). There is a back door in the URN scheme that allows anyone to use what is termed an “experimental” URN namespace. As such there is no attempt to assert the namespace is anything other than something used temporarily or for experimental purposes.</para>
    <para>Thus, if a user is not managing namespace URIs as organizational assets, it would be entirely appropriate to use the experimental URN namespace for the User Extension Apex ABIE, User Document ABIE, User Library ABIE and User BBIE collections along the lines as follows (only one URI for
      each collection):</para>
    <para>urn:X-MyCompany:Extension</para>
    <para>urn:X-MyCompany:Document</para>
    <para>urn:X-MyCompany:Aggregate</para>
    <para>urn:X-MyCompany:Basic</para>
    <para>Abbreviated, respectively, using prefix names along the lines of myx:, myd:, mya: and myb:</para>
    <para>An example of a managed set of namespaces would be to use URLs to the organizational web site. This ensures no other organization following proper etiquette would create an ambiguously-identical namespace URI string, whereas two organizations could very well create identical experimental
      URN strings. Using a URL for the URI string provides an added benefit that the URL could deliver information to a browser should anyone attempt to dereference the URL. A common practice is to create an XHTML page with RDDL attributes that guides the reader to information about the XML
      namespace. As mentioned before, an XML processor uses the namespace URI as just a string, so the fact that the string happens also to be a URL does not require the URL to actually exist. Examples of URLs to use as namespace URIs are:</para>
    <para>http://myCompany.com/ns/ubl/Extension</para>
    <para>http://myCompany.com/ns/ubl/Document</para>
    <para>http://myCompany.com/ns/ubl/Aggregate</para>
    <para>http://myCompany.com/ns/ubl/Basic</para>
    <para>Abbreviated, respectively, using prefix names along the lines of mx:, md:, ma: and mb:</para>
